### Get MandArt

First, you'll want to get a copy of the MandArt App. You'll need a Mac.

### Start MandArt

Download install the app and open it on your machine.

### Welcome Screen

The welcome screen offers a chance to open a sample MandArt and start editing from there. We recommend this if this is your first time using the app. 

### Menu

The menu is a pretty standard Mac menu. You can use File / New to make a new document or File / Open... to find one on your machine. 

### Customize Inputs

Customize the inputs and watch MandArt update. 
For more information about each calculated field, see <doc:A02-SettingInputs>.

### Save MandArt


To save your MandArt inputs as a picture definition, remember to click File / Save.

Definitions are in JSON (a simple and common data format) and allow you to save and share your MandArt with others. 

### Save a Printed Image

Use the ðŸŒ… button up at the top to save your generated image as a .png file. 

### Open Saved MandArt

Use File / Open to open a saved MandArt document. 

File / Open Recent is useful if you've got some previous MandArt documents from an earlier session.

### Share MandArt

You can save and share your MandArt document files with others so they can open them in MandArt as well.

### Exploration

Have fun!
