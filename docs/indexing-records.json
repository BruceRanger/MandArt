So, a set of 292 colors that should print well is available by hitting Show Print Colors. The format is the same as for the screen colors, so it is obvious that many of the best colors are missing.

Overview This article shows how to get started creating and saving a custom MandArt image.  Discussion Get MandArt First, youâ€™ll want to get a copy of the MandArt App. Youâ€™ll need a Mac. Start MandArt Download install the app and open it on your machine. Welcome Screen The welcome screen offers a chance to open a sample MandArt and start editing from there. We recommend this if this is your first time using the app. Menu The menu is a pretty standard Mac menu. You can use File \/ New to make a new document or File \/ Openâ€¦ to find one on your machine. Customize Inputs Customize the inputs and watch MandArt update. For more information about each calculated field, see Setting Inputs. Save MandArt To save your MandArt inputs as a picture definition, remember to click File \/ Save. Definitions are in JSON (a simple and common data format) and allow you to save and share your MandArt with others. Save a Printed Image Use the ðŸŒ… button up at the top to save your generated image as a .png file. Open Saved MandArt Use File \/ Open to open a saved MandArt document. File \/ Open Recent is useful if youâ€™ve got some previous MandArt documents from an earlier session. Share MandArt You can save and share your MandArt document files with others so they can open them in MandArt as well.

Overview This article covers the ideas and math behind MandArt and the Mandlebrot set.  Discussion The Mandelbrot Set Now for a little math to help explain whatâ€™s going on. How are these pictures generated? We start with an iterative formula:  where z and c are complex numbers.  and  Since our computers donâ€™t work with complex numbers, and they seem a little scary, we use a little math to get to real numbers. All we really have to know is that i2 = -1 and that an i in front of a number means it is measured along the y axis of the standard x-y plane. The initial value of zn is 0 + i0. The values of x0 and y0 remain fixed while we iterate. Thatâ€™s just part of the definition of the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical formula. It is a complex function that generates a set of complex numbers based on the iteration of a simple equation. The equation is used to generate the points in the complex plane that are part of the Mandelbrot set. The set is named after the French mathematician BenoÃ®t B. Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized it in the late 20th century.","kind":"article","title":"More About The Math","headings":["Overview","Discussion","The Mandelbrot Set","The Mandelbrot set"],"location":{"type":"topLevelPage","reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/MandArt\/documentation\/MandArt\/A04-MoreAboutTheMath","interfaceLanguage":"swift"}},"summary":"MandArt is based on a popular fractal, the Mandlebrot set."},{"rawIndexableTextContent":"Create custom art from the Mandelbrot set.

Overview This article discusses each of the user-supplied inputs used to calculate MandArt.  Discussion Mand App This is an art app, not a math app. It was specifically developed to generate pictures good enough to be printed, framed, and hung. You can completely ignore the math behind it, but it would help to have an idea of whatâ€™s going on. So, weâ€™ll put all of the math at the end. This idea had to wait for modern computers to become available since the process requires a very great number of calculations. The app is written in the Swift computer language and uses SwiftUI for the interface. Mandelbrot and Mini-Mands  Fig 1 shows us the region of the x-y plane where the action will take place. The black area in Fig 1 is the major part of the Mandelbrot set, but around it is an infinite number of smaller, distorted versions of that part. Since we will keep referring to these objects, weâ€™ll call the black area in Fig 1 the Mandelbrot. The other versions of it, which weâ€™ll see soon, weâ€™ll call Mini-Mands. Welcome Screen  Fig 2 shows the opening window in the app. Click on the Welcome to MandArt button. MandArt Main Window  Fig 3 shows the window after opening. The window isnâ€™t big enough to show the whole picture, so draw the lower-right corner until it shows the whole picture. Finding MandArt - Centering and Zooming  Weâ€™ll use Fig 4 to explain centering and zooming. If you click anywhere in the right-hand image, the program will present a new image, centered on that location. If you press and hold the mouse button, you can drag the image. It will take a few seconds to recalculate and show it in the new location. You can zoom in or out by a factor of two by hitting the + or - buttons. Customizing MandArt A number of variables are listed in the buttons in the green area. You can change any of those values and hit return to use those new values. The screen goes blank when you start to enter any values, otherwise the program will update the image when each digit is entered. This is a problem that SwiftUI will solve, hopefully. This lets you fine-tune the image or input a set of values that you found in another reference. Coloring MandArt The next set of variables relate to coloring the image. Default values were chosen so that the initial image would be colored. In order to reduce the number of colors that need to be entered, the program will cycle through the defined colors as many times as necessary. The region between each pair of numbers is called a block of colors. The program will also make a smooth gradient between each pair of colors. To emphasize the defined colors over the gradient colors, a slider is provided to define the fraction of a block that uses the defined color before starting the gradient. If a value near 1 is chosen, the blocks of colors will show up as solid bands. Interesting Areas  Fig. 5 shows typical areas where you might look for interesting images. They seem to be in areas that are near where two black areas come together. Zooming  Fig 6 shows an image that has been zoomed in by a factor of about 2,880,000\/430 = 6,698. There are some obvious paths that seem to flow from the edge of the image into the interior. These paths can only end on the Mandelbot figure or on one of the Mini-Mands. However, the Mini-Mand may be so small that the we wonâ€™t be able to ever see it. If we keep zooming in, eventually the 15-digit significant places of a number in Swift will just start to show big blobs of color. Iterations Before Converging - Minimum The locations with the fewest iterations occur outside of the image, so the program ignores them. If we want to move the initial color in the image into the image, we can enter a value for Change in minimum iteration. If we enter a negative value, weâ€™ll get a white area in the image, indicating where that minimum value is. Maximum Iterations And Blocks of Color We typically use a large value for the maximum number of iterations and a small number for the number of blocks of color so we use an exponential relation between the two. The spacing between colors near the edges of the image, which is far from the Mini-Mand destination, is set by one variable and that near the Mini-Mand destination by another. Only trial and error and artistic preference will determine the best values. Likewise for the number of defined colors and the number of blocks of color. Joining Colors with Gradiants If we define only a few colors, the gradients joining a pair of colors may go through regions of color that donâ€™t look good. To help see what a gradient looks like, hit Go. After that, just enter a different number to see that gradient. To correct the problem, you can change one or both colors or add an intermediate color. Specifying Colors The colors can be defined by inputting the (RGB) values or clicking on a color to get the Color Picker. The Color Picker has an eyedrop tool. This tool can select any color visible, in the app or not. A selection of 512 colors that look good on the screen is available by hitting Show Screen Colors. The eyedropper can be used to select one.","kind":"article","title":"Setting Inputs","headings":["Overview","Discussion","Mand App","Mandelbrot and Mini-Mands","Welcome Screen","MandArt Main Window","Finding MandArt - Centering and Zooming","Customizing MandArt","Coloring MandArt","Interesting Areas","Zooming","Iterations Before Converging - Minimum","Maximum Iterations And Blocks of Color","Joining Colors with Gradiants","Specifying Colors"],"location":{"type":"topLevelPage","reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/MandArt\/documentation\/MandArt\/A02-SettingInputs","interfaceLanguage":"swift"}},"summary":"Setting MandArt inputs to generate custom art."}]
