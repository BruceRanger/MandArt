# Finding a Picture to Color

Doing some exploring.

## Overview

This article discusses all the inputs we need to set the stage for coloring.

### Finding MandArt

We’ll use this picture to explain each of the inputs available in the section 1.Find, which comes up when the app gets started.

### Picture Size

The picture opens with a width of 1100 pixels and a height of 1000 pixels, for a calculated aspect ratio of 1.1.

The values for the picture centering and magnification were chosen to put the whole Mandelbrot in the picture.

### Centering

To go exploring, you can click anywhere in the picture, and 
the program will present a new picture, centered on that location. 

### Dragging

If you press and hold the mouse button, you can drag the picture. 
It may take a few seconds to recalculate and show it in the new location. 

### Zooming

You can zoom in or out by a factor of two by hitting that + or - buttons.

You can also set a custom zoom by putting in a value and then entering it. Then you can zoom in or out by that factor by hitting that + or - buttons.

You can also change the magnification by changing the **Magnification** value and then entering it. 

When you zoom in, it is like looking through a microscope. 
If you zoom in as far as the computer can handle, 
it is like moving a sheet of paper the size of your screen 
around in an area the size of the solar system. 

You should have no trouble finding a picture that no one has ever seen. 

In fact, if you don’t record that location, you’ll probably never be able to find
your way back to it.

### Maximum Tries

The value for maximum tries is originally set to 10,000, but it may have to be increased in order to sharpen the image.

### Rotation

The Rotation input causes a counter-clockwise rotation by the input value in degrees.

### Customizing MandArt

A number of variables are listed in the green area. You can change any of those values and hit **tab**, **return**, or **enter** to use those new values. Sometime, you may have to hit return or enter twice.  You can avoid this by entering any commas in the input instead of letting the program do it.

These values allow you to fine-tune the picture or input a set of values that you found in another reference.
