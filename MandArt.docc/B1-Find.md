### Finding MandArt - Centering, Dragging, and Zooming

![Centering, Dragging, and Zooming](CenteringDraggingZooming.png)

We’ll use this picture to explain centering, dragging, and zooming. 

### Centering

If you click anywhere in the right-hand picture, 
the program will present a new picture, centered on that location. 

### Dragging

If you press and hold the mouse button, you can drag the picture. 
It may take a few seconds to recalculate and show it in the new location. 

### Zooming

You can zoom in or out by a factor of two by hitting the + or - buttons. 
You can also change the magnification by changing the **scale** value. 

When you zoom in, it is like looking through a microscope. 
You can also think of it as expanding the picture. 
If you zoom in as far as the 15 significant places that the Swift variable will allow, 
it is like moving a sheet of paper the size of your screen 
around in an area the size of the solar system. 

You should have no trouble finding a picture that no one has ever seen. 

In fact, if you don’t record that location, you’ll probably never be able to find
your way back.

### Customizing MandArt

A number of variables are listed in the green area. You can change any of those values and hit **tab**, **return**, or **enter** to use those new values. Sometime, you may have to hit return or enter twice.  You can avoid this by entering any commas in the input instead of letting the program do it.

These values allow you to fine-tune the picture or input a set of values that you found in another reference.
