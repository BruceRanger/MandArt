# Finding a Picture to Color

We can do some exploring.

## Overview

This article discusses all the inputs we need to set the stage for coloring.

### Finding MandArt

![Whole Picture Again](WholePicture1.png)

We’ll use this picture to explain each of the inputs available in the section 1.Find, which comes up when the app gets started.

### Picture Size

The picture opens with a width of 1100 pixels and a height of 1000 pixels, for a calculated aspect ratio of 1.1.

The values for the picture centering and magnification were chosen to put the whole Mandelbrot in the picture.

### Centering

To go exploring, you can click anywhere in the picture, and 
the program will present a new picture, centered on that location.
It may take a few seconds to recalculate and show it in the new location. 


### Dragging

If you press and hold the mouse button, you can drag the picture. 

### Zooming

You can zoom in or out by a factor of two by hitting that + or - button.

You can also set a custom zoom by putting in a value and then entering it. Then you can zoom in or out by that factor by hitting that + or - button.

You can also change the magnification by changing the **Magnification** value and then entering it. 

When you zoom in, it is like looking through a microscope. 
If you zoom in as far as the computer can handle, 
it is like moving a sheet of paper the size of your screen 
around in an area the size of the solar system. 

You should have no trouble finding a picture that no one has ever seen. 

In fact, if you don’t record that location, you’ll probably never be able to find
your way back to it.

### Maximum Tries

The value for maximum tries is originally set to 10,000, but it may have to be increased in order to sharpen the image.

### Rotation

The Rotation input causes a counter-clockwise rotation by the input value in degrees.

### Color Smoothing Limit

The color smoothing limit has to be set to something greater than four.
The larger this value is, the smoother the coloring is.
But, any value greater than 40 doesn't seem to help.
Since increasing this value doesn't noticeably slow down the app, we have set the value to 400 and you probably never have to change it.

### Changing the Values

To change any of the values, you can hit **tab**, **return**, or **enter**.

These values allow you to fine-tune the picture or to input a set of values that you found in another reference.

### Finding Interesting Areas

This picture shows some regions where you might look for interesting scenes, indicated by gray dots.
The white dot indicates the region where the first picture in this documentation was located.

They seem to be in regions that are near where two black areas are close together.

Generally, the different sides look very different when you zoom in to see what's there.
