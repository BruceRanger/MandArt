## Overview

### Picking Colors

This app uses the RBG color model, which uses red, green (actually lime), and blue componenents to define the color of a given pixel on the screen.
Each component has a range of 0 to 255.
The R, G, and B components can be thought of as forming a cube.
The pre-selected six colors shown are the six corners of the color cube, without the black and white corners.

### Checking the gradient between adjacent colors

The app makes a smooth gradient between adjacent colors.
You can see what that gradient will look like by selecting a color number in the "From:" box.
The app automatically chooses the next  higher color number and shows a picture of that color gradient.
Depending on the colors chosen, the gradient may pass through a region of color that doesn't look good to you.
In that case, you'll have to change one or both colors, or put in an intermediant color.



### Color Profile

To get the printable colors to work, you may need to adjust your Color Profile.

Open System Settings / Displays / Color Profile - and on the drop-down, 
select the sRGB option as shown below.

### Visible Scroll Bars

There's typically a scroll bar on the right side of the input area,
unless your monitor is tall enough to see all the inputs without it. 

If you'd like to make your scrollbar visible all the time 
(rather than just when working in the input area), you'll use
Mac settings again.

Open System Settings / Appearance / Show Scroll Bars - and select always.
