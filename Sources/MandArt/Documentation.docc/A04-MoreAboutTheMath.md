# More About The Math

MandArt is based on a popular fractal, the Mandlebrot set. 


## Overview

This article covers the ideas and math behind MandArt and the Mandlebrot set.

### The Mandelbrot Set

Now for a little math to help explain what’s going on.

How are these pictures generated? We start with an iterative formula: 

zn + 1 = zn2 + c

where z and c are complex numbers. z = x + iy and c = x0 + iy0. 

Since our computers don’t work with complex numbers, and they seem a little scary, we use a little math to get to real numbers. 

All we really have to know is that i2 = -1 and that an i in front of a number means it is measured along the y axis of the standard x-y plane. 

The initial value of zn is 0 + i0. The values of x0 and y0 remain fixed while we iterate. 

That’s just part of the definition of the Mandelbrot set.


### The Mandelbrot set

The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical formula. 
It is a complex function that generates a set of complex numbers based on the iteration of a simple equation. 
The equation is used to generate the points in the complex plane that are part of the Mandelbrot set. 
The set is named after the French mathematician Benoît B. Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized it in the late 20th century.
