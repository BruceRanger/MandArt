/// `PanelUI` is a SwiftUI view struct available for macOS 12.0 and later.
/// It provides a user interface panel for managing inputs and settings in the MandArt application.
/// This view allows users to interact with and control
/// the parameters of the Mandelbrot set generation and visualization process.
///
/// The view observes a `MandArtDocument` object for data related to the Mandelbrot set calculations
/// and binds to `requiresFullCalc` and `showGradient` to manage state updates and view rendering.
/// It also manages pop-up interactions through a `PopupManager` object, enhancing the user experience.
///
/// The view consists of a tabbed interface (`TabbedView`) that organizes settings and
/// options, to locate an interesting spot, specify the colors, and tune the way the image is displayed. It provides the
/// critical interface for users to interact with the core aspects of the MandArt application.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - doc: An observed `MandArtDocument` object containing the current state and data of the Mandelbrot set.
///   - popupManager: An observed `PopupManager` object for managing pop-up interactions within the application.
///   - requiresFullCalc: A binding Bool that indicates whether a full calculation of the Mandelbrot set is needed.
///   - showGradient: A binding Bool that determines whether to display a gradient preview or a fully calculated image.
